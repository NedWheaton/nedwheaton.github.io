This is my first attempt at uploading a post with Jekyll. I'll delete it once the site is up and running. Since this is a markdown file, I assume I can do things like this:
# Header 1 #
## Header 2 ##
### Header 3 ###
I should even be able to include block quotes as follows:
> Turning and turning in the widening gyre
> The falcon cannot hear the falconer;
> Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;
> Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,
I can also make lists:
* item 1
* item 2
* item 3
